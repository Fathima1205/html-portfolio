        <a href="https://open.spotify.com/"><img src="../assets/images/Spotify.jpeg" alt="Spotify" height="35"/></a> <br /> <br />
        
        Spotify is your personal DJ with zero judgment. You start with a "just a little playlist" and end up in 
        weirdly specific ones like "Songs to Cry in the Shower" or "90s Hits That Should've Stayed in the 90s." 
        It takes you from indie vibes to belting 2000s pop like you're headlining a concert.

            <li>My all time favourite app/website </li>
            <li>It is the Social Media without Social</li>
        </ul>
        Think of it as your personal idea vault, where you can organize inspirations into neatly labeled boards 
        and endlessly scroll through a world of aesthetic perfection, all while secretly pretending 
        you’ll try half the things you pin.

    <li>
        <a href="https://flixhq.pe/home"><img src="../assets/images/Flixhq.png" alt="Flixhq" height="30"/></a> <br/>
        : for watching free movies and shows <br /> <br />
        FlixHQ is the ultimate binge-watcher's paradise—an online treasure trove of free movies and TV shows. 
        It’s where you can catch that random series or dive into the latest blockbuster, all without annoying ads 
        (well, most of the time). No subscriptions, no fuss, just pure, uninterrupted entertainment.
    </li>
    <br />

    <li>
        <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/"><img src="../assets/images/Webtoon.jpeg" alt="Webtoon" height="80"/></a> <br /> <br />
        It’s where you go to read “just one episode” and suddenly it’s 3 a.m., your heart’s been broken 12 times, 
        and you’re emotionally invested in a love triangle between a demon, a ghost, and a barista. A rabbit hole 
        of amazing art, chaotic plot twists, and characters you’ll simp for harder than your crush. 
        Also, good luck waiting a week for the next episode—it’s pure pain with pretty pictures!
    </li>
    <br />

    <li>
        <a href="https://chatgpt.com/"><img src="../assets/images/ChatGPT.png" alt="ChatGPT" height="30"/></a> <br /> <br />
        Last but definitely not the least, ChatGPT, the digital sidekick who’s always here to help, whether 
        you need answers, advice, or just someone to chat with while you procrastinate. It can help you solve problems, 
        make up stories, or give you weird facts, all without ever needing a coffee break (because, well, 
        It’m not human). Think of it as the friend who knows a little too much... but in a good way!
