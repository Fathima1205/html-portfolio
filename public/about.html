<h1>Hi, I’m Fathima :)</h1>

<p>I’m a beginner coder💻👩‍💻 on an exciting journey through the world of programming. The more I dive into it, the more I realize <br />
   how much I love the endless creativity that coding allows. From writing my first line of code to building my first web page, <br />
   every step feels like unlocking a new level. I’m passionate about learning🤓 and growing in the tech world, and I’m all about <br />
   exploring new tools, languages, and frameworks.</p>

<p>My ambition? To become a successful web development freelancer👩‍💻. I’m focused on mastering the craft and turning my skills <br/>
  into projects that people can connect with. For me, coding is not just about writing code—it's about creating something <br />
  functional, meaningful, and even beautiful. There’s something so satisfying about seeing an idea come to life on the screen, <br />
  knowing that every line of code brings you closer to the final product🥰.</p>

<p>But coding isn’t all I do. When I step away from the screen, I love escaping into the worlds of fiction📖. Whether it’s <br />
  philosophical-fiction, fantasy, thrilling mysteries, or crime stories, I’m all in for stories that push boundaries and <br />
  make me think. Reading fuels my imagination and helps me think outside the box—something that I definitely bring into <br />
  my coding journey.</p>

<p>I’m also a big fan of drawing🎨🖌️, food🍕🍔, and of course, watching movies and series🎞️🍿. I find inspiration in the creativity of <br />
  others, whether it's through art, a delicious dish, or a gripping TV show. The beauty of these things? They remind me that <br />
  coding isn’t just about logic and syntax—it’s about creativity, problem-solving, and expressing yourself in new and exciting ways.</p>

<p>So, whether I’m coding, reading, or experimenting with my next drawing, I’m always learning and striving to push myself further. <br />
  Every challenge is an opportunity to grow, and I can’t wait to see where this journey takes me.</p>
  
<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
