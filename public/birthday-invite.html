<p> 

    So I'm planning to celebrate my Nineteenth 365-days trip around the sun.  <br />
    That definitely calls for a party right!!!!
</p>
<p>Don't even think about coming freely;)</p>
<h3>Here are the things you can bring:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>An appetite (There will be lots of food and drinks)</li>
    <li>Dance Moves (Don't worry, no choreography required ‚Äì just vibe with the music)</li>
    <li>Good Vibes (They‚Äôre mandatory!)</li>
    <li>Secret Talent (Ready to show it off?!)</li>
    <li>Gifts (Who doesn't love gifts, not mandatory coz you are the best gift ever;))</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p> That being said there are definitely thing you dare not bring to the party</p>
<h3>Don't dare bring these:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A diet plan (We're throwing it out the window tonight!)</li>
    <li>The 'boring' attitude (It's a celebration, not a snooze fest!)</li>
    <li>The ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too shy‚Äù mentality (Let‚Äôs dance and laugh like no one‚Äôs watching!)</li>
    <li>A grumpy face (Smiles only, please!)</li>
    <li>A stopwatch (Your won't be leaving any time soon)</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah now that includes everything.</p>

<p> Join me <b>at sunset</b> (or whenever you can drag yourself out of bed) 
    <b>at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@35.7040744,139.5577317,3a,75y,289.6h,87.01t,0.72r/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sgT28ssf0BB2LxZ63JNcL1w!2e0!7i13312!8i6656">MY PLACE</a> </b><br />
    for a celebration you won't forget‚Äîunless you eat too much cake, <br />
    then good luck remembering anything!
